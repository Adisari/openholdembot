Per default we ship several tablemaps for poker-simulators
and exclude real-world tablemaps to keep the download small.

This directory contains all "official" real-world tablemaps,
plus one replay-frame per map as setup-instruction.
To get all these tablemaps execute the script Update_Tablemaps.bat.
